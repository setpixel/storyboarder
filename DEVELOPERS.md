# Notes for Developers

Tested with node v6.1.0.

## Developing

Use Node Version Manager to set the proper version of Node in your environment:

    $ nvm use

> If you do not have `nvm` on your machine, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to install it.

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

## Loading Storyboards via Command Line

Storyboarder accepts an argument for the path to a filename to load when starting up:

    $ npm start ../fixtures/example.storyboarder

## Testing

You can run a quick view test using [`budo`](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo) if you have it installed globally (e.g. `npm install -g budo`)

    $ cd test/views/guides
    $ budo index.js --live
    $ open http://localhost:9966

`budo` will "Live Reload" changes as you work, in either the main source or the test harness.

## Building a Release

    $ npm run dist:mac    # Mac only
    $ npm run dist:win    # Windows only
    $ npm run dist:linux  # Linux only
    $ npm run dist        # All Platforms

If cross-compiling from Mac to Windows, install [Wine](see https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build) first.

For Linux, you will need these dependencies:

- icnsutils - provides `icns2png`
- graphicsmagick

It is possible to [build for Linux on other platforms using a Docker container](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Docker). See instructions below.

### Building for Linux and Windows with Docker for Mac

Install [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac), then:

```
git clone git@github.com:wonderunit/storyboarder.git storyboarder
docker run --rm -ti -v ${PWD}:/project -v ${PWD##*/}-node-modules:/project/node_modules -v ~/.electron:/root/.electron electronuserland/electron-builder:wine
cd storyboarder
npm install
npm prune
npm run dist:linux
npm run dist:win
```

## Testing Auto-Update

- `latest.yml` (for Windows) and `latest-mac.yml` (for Mac) must be published in the GitHub Release along with the other release files.

To test auto update, create a file called `dev-app-update.yml` in the root source folder with contents like:

```
owner: wonderunit
repo: storyboarder
provider: github
```

... then decrement the current version in `package.json`. You will be notified that the app is out-of-date (although in dev mode, when unsigned, Squirrel.Mac will throw `Error: Could not get code signature for running application`)

## Publishing

Be sure to have a local `GH_TOKEN` environment variable. For the value:

    Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
    Token description: Storyboarder Publishing
    Select scopes: [x] public_repo

Create a Draft in GitHub Releases as the target for publishing

Then, publish:

    GH_TOKEN={...} npm run dist:mac -- --publish onTagOrDraft
    GH_TOKEN={...} npm run dist:win -- --publish onTagOrDraft
    GH_TOKEN={...} npm run dist:linux -- --publish onTagOrDraft

## Deploying

Remember to sync data files that have server representation (like `messages.json`).

## Vendored Libraries

We're using a modified version of [drop](https://github.com/HubSpot/drop), forked at [wonderunit/drop](https://github.com/wonderunit/drop) with a fix from [HubSpot/drop/pull/171](https://github.com/HubSpot/drop/pull/171) applied.
We keep a built version in `src/js/vendor/tether-drop` which is referenced by `package-lock.json`.
To make changes, work from a clone of the fork, build, and copy the built `drop.js` to `src/js/vendor/tether-drop/dist/js/drop.js`.
